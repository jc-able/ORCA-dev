# ORCA Lead Management Software

ORCA is a comprehensive lead management tool designed to provide salespeople in membership-based businesses (gyms and similar community organizations) with a comprehensive tool to manage leads, communicate with them, track their progress, and leverage referrals through a streamlined appointment scheduling system and text blast functionality. The key feature of ORCA is the referral system which allows the salesperson to manage sales leads, Members (converted leads), Member referrals (leads invited and linked to member and salesperson), and personal refferal (leads invited and linked to salesperson). This allows the salesperson to maximize sales by efficiently utilizing the power of a referral system.

## Database Structure

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the ORCA database schema, designed to align with the requirements specified in the PRD.

### Core Design Principles

- **Unified Person Model**: A single `persons` table serves as the foundation for all contact types (leads, referrals, members)
- **Extension Pattern**: Specialized data is stored in extension tables that reference the base person record
- **Relationship Tracking**: Explicit modeling of relationships between people for referral network analysis
- **Activity Monitoring**: Comprehensive tracking of all interactions and communications
- **Flexible Data Storage**: Use of JSONB and array types for evolving data needs
- **Audit Trail**: Timestamp tracking for all major actions and status changes

> **Note**: For complete schema documentation, see our [Schema Reference Guide](docs/schema/README.md) which includes detailed field definitions, constraints, API integration guides, and developer guidelines.

## Database Schema Alignment

To ensure our codebase is fully aligned with the database schema, we've created a comprehensive reference of the current database schema in [server/db/schema/current_schema.sql](server/db/schema/current_schema.sql).

### Identified Schema Inconsistencies

After comparing the TypeScript interfaces with the SQL schema, the following inconsistencies were identified:

#### TypeScript Interface Issues

1. **Interaction Interface**:
   - Missing proper nullable/required designations for fields
   - `attachments` is defined as an array of objects with `name`, `url`, and `type` properties, but the SQL schema uses `jsonb[]`
   - `sentiment` is restricted to 'positive' | 'neutral' | 'negative' in TS but is a free-form text field in SQL

2. **Message Interface**:
   - `message_type` is restricted to 'email' | 'sms' | 'blast' in TS, but is a free-form text field in SQL
   - `content` and `message_type` are marked as NOT NULL in SQL but don't have proper required designations in TS

3. **LeadExtension Interface**:
   - `lead_temperature` is typed as 'hot' | 'warm' | 'cold' in TS, but is a free-form text field in SQL
   - Missing SQL constraint enforcement for `readiness_score` (1-10) and `conversion_probability` (0-100)

4. **Relationship Interface**:
   - `relationship_type` is optional in TS, but NOT NULL in SQL
   - `status` is restricted to 'active' | 'inactive' in TS, but is a free-form text field in SQL
   - Missing constraint enforcement for `relationship_level` (>= 1) and `attribution_percentage` (0-100)

5. **General Issues**:
   - Timestamp fields are typed as `string` in TS, but should be more specific
   - SQL schema uses `numeric` type for monetary values, but TS uses `number`
   - JSON/JSONB handling inconsistencies between SQL and TS
   - Constraint validations from SQL not reflected in TS interfaces

#### Model Implementation Issues

1. **Model Field Definitions**:
   - Model files define fields in comments but these don't always match actual SQL schema
   - Missing validation logic for SQL constraints like NOT NULL, unique constraints, and check constraints

2. **Client-Side References**:
   - Client code makes direct references to database fields without type checking
   - Inconsistent field naming between client and server

### Database Schema Alignment Tasks

- **Run Command**: `cd server && npm run test:models`

Model tests verify that the data layer correctly interacts with the Supabase database and implements all required business logic, including:
- Proper handling of relationships between models
- Correct filtering and pagination
- Error handling and validation
- Extension pattern for lead, referral, and member data

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
cd server && npm test

# Run only model tests
cd server && npm run test:models

# Run tests with coverage report
cd server && npm run test:coverage
```
